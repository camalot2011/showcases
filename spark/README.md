# Stack Overflow Analysis with Spark

In this folder, I perform the analysis on the stack overflow posts using the pyspark framework. The `stack_overflow.ipynb` notebook is the main file contains all the explanation. All the test work was done inside the notebook.

There are also one utility scripts `myutils.py` and three python scripts. Those were used to submit jobs to the Google Cloud Platform. The command lines were all inside the python notebook mentioned above.
